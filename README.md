# PCG Classification Paper

This repository contains the research materials and code for my study titled:
**“Enhanced PCG Classification Using Wavelet Denoising and Feature Optimization of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Power Spectral Density (PSD)”**, 
which was presented at **IEEE ICCTEIE 2025**, where it received the **Best Presenter Award**.

## Contents
- `presentation/` — Conference presentation slides (PDF)
- `code/` — Source code for signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification (to be added)
- `results/` — Visual results and evaluation metrics (upcoming)

## Summary
This work focuses on **heart sound (PCG) classification** using a hybrid feature optimization method. 
Wavelet denoising was used for signal enhancement, while EMD and PSD features were optimized for better discrimination between normal and abnormal PCG signals.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- PyEMD, PyWavelets, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Recognition
- **Best Presenter Award**, IEEE ICCTEIE 2025  
- Indexed by **IEEE Xplore**
